I've always believed that great design should be inclusive by default. Over the past year, I've been diving deeper into accessibility standards and wanted to share some insights beyond the typical WCAG checklist.

When I redesigned the Bloom Finance dashboard last quarter, our team faced a challenge: how do we make complex financial data both visually appealing and accessible to users with various needs? The answer wasn't just about adding alt text or ensuring keyboard navigation (though those are essential).

I started by mapping out user journeys specifically for people using screen readers and those with motor impairments. This revealed several pain points in our original design that weren't obvious to our sighted team members.

The breakthrough came when we invited three users with different accessibility needs to participate in our design sprints. Their direct input transformed our approachâ€”we developed a modular interface that adapts to different interaction methods without compromising functionality.

What I learned is that accessibility isn't a layer you add at the end; it's a fundamental design principle that should inform every decision from day one. When we design with the edges in mind, everyone benefits from the clarity and thoughtfulness that results.

Next time you start a project, I encourage you to ask: "Who might be excluded by this design choice?" The answers will lead to better solutions for everyone.
